# Austro Simulator

Austro Simulator is a CPU simulator with some similarities to Intel 8086.

Originally it was created for a course assignment back in 2013, but since then, I believed it
can be used as a educational tool for Computer Architecture students. So this software is fully
open source under GPL v3 license.

This software is developed with Python 3 and Qt UI toolkit. You can see how it looks like [here][docs-screenshot].

The assembly language documentation can be found [here][docs-assembly].
