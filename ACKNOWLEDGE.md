Acknowledgements
================

I would like to express my very great appreciation to Prof. Marco Tulio Chella,
firstly to create the opportunity to make this piece of software that increased
many of my abbilities very much. In second place I am particularly grateful for
his assistance and patience every time doubts appeared, which was a very often.

I wish to to acknowledge the help by suggestions, and some other little things,
provided by my fellows, specially to Renato Silveira. Thank you all!

And for the last and not less important, I am very grateful to my family: my
wife Patricia and my little daughters Ana and Alice for the patience and
understanding. I love you!
